# PEGS History
This site is a place to review and share moments of our history together as Lindbergh PEGS students and alumni.
## What is PEGS?
PEGS stands for Program for Exceptionally Gifted Students. Housed at Lindbergh Schools, 
the program has helped its bright students to learn at a more comfortable pace since 1900. 
Just kidding, not sure of the starting date; I'll check on that.
