# PEGS History
This site is a place to review and share moments of our history together as Lindbergh PEGS 
students and alumni.

## What is PEGS?
PEGS stands for Program for Exceptionally Gifted Students. Housed at Lindbergh Schools, 
the program has helped its bright students to learn at a more comfortable pace since 1991.

## Networking
In the future, we plan to add a way to do networking with other PEGS alumni so we can 
raise scholarship funds, plan reunions, and coordinate our world domination schemes.
Maybe simply being able to publicly post your LinkedIn profile and browse the profiles 
of other PEGS alumni would be plenty.
