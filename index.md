# PEGS History
This site is a place to review and share moments of our history together as Lindbergh PEGS 
students and alumni.

## What is PEGS?
PEGS stands for Program for Exceptionally Gifted Students. Housed at Lindbergh Schools, 
the program has helped its bright students to learn at a more comfortable pace since 1991.

## Networking
In the future, we plan to add a way to do networking with other PEGS alumni so we can 
raise scholarship funds, plan reunions, and coordinate our world domination schemes.
Maybe simply being able to publicly post your LinkedIn profile and browse the profiles 
of other PEGS alumni would be plenty.

## Creating this site
This PEGS alumni site was dreamed up first by Charissa Black and typed up by Jon Black. 
Our family has been present for a very significant chunk of PEGS history. Charissa was 
in one of the first PEGS classes and went on to be a PEGS foreign language teacher. Then 
Kathleen and Jon later went through PEGS. So for any of you who know one of us, that's 
who's behind this site.
